# Machine-Learning
This repositary consists of step by step explanination of  Machine Learning Algorithm with a sample projects by implementing those algorithms

## Machine Learning Algorithm
1. [Linear Regression](./Linear-Regression "Linear Regression")

## QUICK LOOK
1.  Split data into 2 sets
      1.  Train Dataset
      2.  Test Dataset
2.  Model
      1.  Overfitting - Testing error is large (high variance low bias)
      2.  Bestfit 
      3.  Underfitting - Training error is large (low variance high bias)
3.  Types of Erroes
      1.  Irreducible error - Occurs in Data
      2.  Reducible error
            1.  bias error - difference between average prediction and correct value
            2.  variance error - variability of model prediction for the given data
4.  To Train and Test Model we need Input and Output            
      * Input - Source, Feature, Training, X, X_train, X_test, X_valid
      * Output - Target, Label, Y, Y_train, Y_test, Y_valid, class/classes
